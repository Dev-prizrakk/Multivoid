// coop/items/player_profile.h -- everything about one player that is theirs and not the world's:
// what they carry, wear and hold, their vitals, and where they stood.
//
// The game keeps all of it on the one save object a world is built from, and a joiner's world is
// built from a capture of the HOST's. So each part is replaced on the joiner's side before the
// world exists, or the joiner starts as a copy of the host: the host's items under the host's
// keys, the host's hunger, the host's position. coop/items/inventory_wire carries this value,
// coop/items/player_inventory_sync stores it per player on the host and hands it back at a join.
