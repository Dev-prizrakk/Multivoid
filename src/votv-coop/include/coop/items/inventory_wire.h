// coop/items/inventory_wire.h -- serialize the per-player profile <-> a byte blob.
//
// Turns coop::player_profile::Profile (items, vitals and pose, read off the live save object
// and the pawn) into a self-contained, version-prefixed little-endian byte blob, and back. FNames and UClasses
// are wired as STRINGS -- pointers are not portable -- and re-interned or FindClass'd on apply,
// with the exact case preserved. The FTransform packs as 10 floats, and the 0x70 signal
// sub-element reuses the coop/signal_wire serializer rather than a second one.
//
// The blob is what coop/blob_chunks carries in chunks (client->host), what persists to
// <gameDir>/coop_players/<hostSlot>/<guid>.json, and what the join apply reads back.
