// coop/props/pile_look.h -- the host's look of a chip pile, on every peer.
//
// The mesh a player sees on a pile is a child of the pile's root, and the game's init() turns and
// scales it at random on every construction, a save load included (ue_wrap/actors/chip_pile.h), so
// two peers that load one save draw two looks for one pile. The host's draw is the authority: it
// rides every expression of a pile (PropSpawn, a kToPile PropConvert) as a WirePileLook.
//
// A client binds an actor to a host eid at many moments (the join bracket's own-save bind, a
// materialised mirror, the quiescence re-bind after GC churn) and the look can arrive before or
// after any of them, so it is kept per eid: whichever of the two arrives second completes the
// pair, at remote_prop::RegisterPropMirror, the one entry every bind goes through. Mid-join needs
// nothing of its own: the snapshot expresses every pile, and each expression carries the look.
// MTA keeps such state ON the element (an object's scale: CEntityAddPacket, CObjectRPCs); the side
// map per eid is the divergence, because a look can arrive before its element exists. Game thread.
