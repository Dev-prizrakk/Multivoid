// coop/session/shutdown.h -- centralised close and process-exit handling. Our ProcessEvent
// detour stays installed through the engine's teardown, which keeps firing ProcessEvent
// calls during GC, RHI and world teardown after the window close; those land in our
// trampoline, an observer body reads half-destroyed object memory, a fault inside the
// trampoline interacts badly with the loader lock, and the OS spins the process with the
// engine's whole working set still mapped. Detached worker threads also loop on a sleep with
// no exit condition and keep posting game-thread tasks into a dead pump. The fix: subclass
// the game window's procedure and, on the close message, run the shutdown before the engine
// starts its teardown calls, in this order: set the flag, stop the net session (joining the
// net thread), sleep briefly so polling worker loops observe the flag and exit, disable the
// ProcessEvent patch so later teardown calls hit the original engine code, then lift every
// remaining patch. Nothing is freed on this path: MinHook is never uninitialised and no hook
// removed, since both free the trampoline a thread may still be returning through (see
// ue_wrap/core/hook.h). Every infinite worker loop polls the flag. Nothing waits from
// DllMain under the loader lock, and nothing swallows the detour's fault: it is removed first.

// FlushLogAtProcessExit.

// The only work the process-detach path may do: flush the log, and nothing else. The detach
// branch once ran the full shutdown under a claim that it only set a flag and uninstalled the
// detour; it does far more, and seven of the operations it reaches are hostile under the loader
// lock: it takes the slow mutex (at process exit the owner may be a thread Windows already
// terminated, and such a mutex never unlocks); the session stop joins the net thread, closes
// connections with a network-I/O linger loop, and resets the signaling socket; a sleep; the
// game-thread uninstall reaches MinHook's thread freeze (a toolhelp snapshot plus thread
// suspends) with another sleep; and the blanket disable reaches the same freeze, a documented
// deadlock risk on this path. None of it is useful here: the loader pins the module before
// anything else, so this branch runs only at process exit, where Windows has already terminated
// every other thread; quiescing waits on the dead. Nothing of the session is persisted here
// either: a player's profile is cut to disk with the host's world save and at no other moment
// (coop/player/player_profile_store.h).
