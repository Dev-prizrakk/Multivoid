// coop/save/save_block.h -- client-side world-save block. During a coop session the HOST's save is
// the single canonical one; CLIENTS must not write the world save -- their pre-coop save is left
// UNTOUCHED, and coop-only mirror state (phantom props and NPCs) is never serialized into a
// client's slot. The write block below is decided when a save fires: shut for a client in a
// running session and for as long as the mirror world that session built is still what is loaded,
// open otherwise -- so a player who has left plays single-player again and saves, and a host's save
// is always written. The cycle block is set on the mirror's gamemode and dies with that world.
// The WRITE block is a gate on the engine's save function (ue_wrap/engine/save_to_slot_hook, the
// chokepoint every save path funnels through): it cancels a write of the world-save container
// (saveSlot_C); the harmless meta save (save_main_C) never reaches it.
// The CYCLE block holds gamemode.disableSave true, which saveSlot_C::save tests at its head and
// returns on, before the world gather (saveObjects) and the write funnel. The gamemode's own
// triggers funnel through save(), and no bytecode in mainGamemode ever writes disableSave; a few
// callers elsewhere reach the engine's save function without it, which is what the write block is
// for.
